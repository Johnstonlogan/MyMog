MyMog is an application targeted towards World Of Warcraft transmog collectors. 

MyMog allows user to host/participate in community driven transmog tournaments. 

Running this should be as simple as making your way into the client directory and npm start, assuming you've installed all dependencies. 


MyMog is built using Typescript/React for all major components. This started off as more of a learning (typescript: TS) tool but TS has become extremely nice to use the more I learn it. 
Something Iâ€™ve been focusing on is React composability, really making sure that each component I build is something reusable throughout the whole project. This is something I 
learned to focus on after building quite a few components already so some may still be in the process of being refactored.
